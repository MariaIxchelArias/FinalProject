Bank Account Project by Maria Ixchel Arias Cruz

This program demonstrates the use of classes to create a bank account program. The program asks the user the amounts of deposits and withdrawals for a savings account and checking account.

The program uses the next concepts: Loopings Conditional statements Classes Inheritance Polymorphism type casting link lists

The program uses two derived classes: SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount.The savings account has the member functions to check if the balance of savings account falls below $25; moreover, SavingsAccount member functions will check if the account is active or inactive before doing any transaction. SavingsAccount member function will add a service charge $1 for each withdraws above 4. The second derived class Checking account will have the functions to make available written check withdraw. If the balance goes below $0 a service charge of 15 will be taken from the account; moreover, there will be a monthly fee of $5 plus $.10 per withdraw. Finally the program displays the number of transactions per month using the Transactions class.
